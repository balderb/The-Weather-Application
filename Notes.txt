*** notes on synchronous and asynchronous code

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxWMxJONp7E


Javascript code runs on a single threat (can do 1 thing at a time)

synchronous code waits for 1 action to complete before moving on to the next thing

Example:

- var article = readSync(article_log);
    console.log(article);

var authors = readSync(authors_loc);
    console.log(authors);

We wonder what happens if article_log is extremely large and takes 10 seconds to read(?)
This way we would block our code right there.
